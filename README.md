# memo

A pet-project implementation of the memo game I built with React.
I have put together a minimalist playable version as a fun little challenge.
With the most recent update I have added what I call a "sticky card effect" where the card follows your cursor a bit when you hover over it.
As my next step, I am planning to use the [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.dev/) library to make this effect more lifelike. 
After that I will add a points counter, some nice animation when you win, the ability to reload the game field after you win, and maybe some options to customize your game (like choosing custom images and changing the number of cards you play with).
